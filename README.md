## Overview

Warehouses require efficient space management and precise floor mapping to optimize storage and automation. Traditional mapping methods are time-consuming and prone to human errors. This project proposes an autonomous spherical bot capable of floor plan generation and dimension mapping using Ultrasonic sensors and MPU. The bot navigates autonomously, collects spatial data, and generates a detailed warehouse floor plan.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 📐 **Multi-Dimensional Representation:** Translates complex input data (e.g., spatial coordinates, sensor readings, semantic labels) into structured dimension maps.
- 🗺️ **Visualization Support:** Generates interpretable 2D/3D visualizations for mapped dimensions.
- 🤖 **Modular Design:** Easily plug into autonomous bots, sensor networks, or analytical pipelines.
- 🧠 **ML-Ready Outputs:** Outputs are structured for feeding into machine learning models for tasks like prediction, classification, or anomaly detection.
- ⚙️ **Applications:** Warehouse floor mapping, robotic localization, multidimensional simulations, and smart grid layout analysis.

## 🛠️ System Workflow

### 1. Data Acquisition
Accepts input data from sensors, CSV logs, or simulation environments.

### 2. Preprocessing & Feature Extraction
Handles missing values, normalizes inputs, and encodes spatial or categorical dimensions.

### 3. Dimension Mapping
Maps entities across physical (x, y, z), temporal (t), and logical dimensions using custom or learned transformation matrices.

### 4. Visualization
Renders 2D heatmaps or 3D scatter/mesh plots using matplotlib, plotly, or Open3D.

### 5. Export/Integration
Saves structured maps and embeddings to disk for downstream analysis or robotic control.

## 📌 Use Cases

- 📦 **Warehouse Robotics:** Map and navigate high-traffic warehouse zones.
- 🌐 **Sensor Networks:** Organize IoT data streams by physical/temporal zones.
- 🧬 **Scientific Research:** Map simulations across time, temperature, or spatial scales.
- 🧭 **3D Environment Mapping:** Create coordinate-aware maps for drones or bots.
